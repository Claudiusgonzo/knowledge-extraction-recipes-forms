# Normalization

Have a look at the [jupyter notebook](preprocess_document.ipynb) which contains helper functions for preprocessing scanned documents prior to performing knowledge extraction using Forms Understanding or OCR.

The included functionality:

* Descriptive statistics on scanned document
* Normalization
* Turn into grayscale
* Binarization
